# Slack-NLP

## Natural Language Processing

This bot will be using the text of a Slack user to best emulate that user. This will require the bot be invited to many of the channels that the desired user is in. The more text/dialouge that can be pulled to generate responses the better. 

## Responses

The bot will reposnd when the person being emulated is called with '@user.name' is called in a channel that the bot is in.
